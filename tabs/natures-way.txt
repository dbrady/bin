Nature's Way - Kensington Studios

This is accompanied by a fast folk or travis pick, kind of a hybrid of
travis and the "Dust in the Wind" T2, T, 1, T, 2, T, 1 pick.

Need tabs for the melody, then work out the chords, and from there the
travis picking.

Lyrics:

In a field far away from the city
There's a tree that's older than my grandfather's father
And it's all okay, some things stay the same

In a city far away from the tree
There's a building taller than the peak of Denali
And it's all okay, nothing stays the same

(Chorus)
Ohhhhh, winds are coming
Branches start to fray
I've been thinkin'
That's just nature's way

I walked down to the banks of the river
And I found a stone that was perfect for skipping
Yeah it's all okay
Some things stay the same

(Chorus)
Ooooh, winds are coming
Branches start to fray
I've been thinkin'
That's just nature's way

Mmm-hmm-mm

In a field far away from the city
There's a tree that's older than my grandmother's mother
And it's all okay, some things stay the same

And it's all okay
Nothing stays the same
