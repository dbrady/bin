Tim Pierce - Livestream

Showing off two pieces by Steve Lukather playing incredibly simply, including
Michael McDonald's "I Keep Forgettin'", where he plays a one-note rhythm in the
chorus in order to create space for the vocalist and other musicians to step
forward. Steve was/is the guitarist for Toto, but was also a working studio
musician the whole time we was working in Toto. Steve also played rhythm guitar
in Michael Jackson's "Human Nature", and that's another example of Steve having
"all the firepower in the world", and still choosing to back off and let the
other bandmates have their space.

"I get chills just thinking about it." -- Tim Pierce. Dave notes: this makes me
think of the tendency of very senior programmers to write code that looks as
simple as first-year CS students. Not because they can't write a big complicated
program, but because they know the right small program to solve the
problem. (And that's the difference between senior and junior: writing the RIGHT
small program. Or, going back to music, knowing how and when to play "the right
wrong notes".)

"If you're making music, everything's in service of the piece of music that
you're working on, and a lot of guitar players get obsessed with stuff that's
outside that realm... so... (laughs)"
