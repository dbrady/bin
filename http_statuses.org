|-----+-------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1** | Informational                 |                                                                                                                 |

| 100 | Continue                      | Server has received request headers and client should proceed to send the request body                          |
| 101 | Switching Protocols           | Requester has asked server to switch protocols and the server has agreed to do so                               |
| 102 | Processing (WebDAV; RFC 2518) | A WebDAV request may contain many subrequests; this response keeps the client from disconnecting due to timeout |
| 103 | Checkpoint [Unofficial]       | Used in the resumable requests proposal to resume aborted PUT or POSTS requests                                 |
| 103 | Early Hints [Unofficial]      | Used to return some response headers before entire HTTP response                                                |

| 2×× | Success                             |                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-----+-------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 200 | OK                                  | Standard response for successful HTTP requests                                                                                                                                       |
| 201 | Created                             | Request has been fulfilled resulting in the creation of a new resource                                                                                                               |
| 202 | Accepted                            | Request has been accepted for processing but the processing has not been completed (request may or may not be completed and may be disallowed when processing occurs)                |
| 203 | Non-authoritative Information       | The server is a transforming proxy that received a 200 OK from its origin, but is returning a modified version of the origin's response                                              |
| 204 | No Content                          | The server successfully processed the request and is not returning any content                                                                                                       |
| 205 | Reset Content                       | Same as 204 but the requester is required to reset the document view                                                                                                                 |
| 206 | Partial Content (RFC 7233)          | The server is delivering only part of the resource (e.g. byte serving) due to a range header sent by the client (used to resume downloads or split a download into multiple streams) |
| 207 | Multi-Status (WebDAV; RFC 4918)     | Message body contains an XML message that can contain separate response codes depending on how many sub-requests were made                                                           |
| 208 | Already Reported (WebDAV; RFC 5842) | The members of a DAV binding have already been enumerated in a preceding part of the (multistatus) response, and are not being included again                                        |
| 226 | IM Used (RFC 3229)                  | The server has fulfilled the request for a resource, and the response is a representation of the result of one or more Instance Manipulations applied to the current instance        |

| 3×× | Redirection                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-----+-------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 300 | Multiple Choices              | Multiple options for the resource exist from which the client may choose (agent-driven content negotiation)                                                                                        |
| 301 | Moved Permanently             | This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI                                                                                                                                   |
| 302 | Found                         | WARNING: Industry practice contradicts standard. RFC 1945 defined it as "Moved Temporarily", industry implemnted it as 303. Treat a 302 like a 303 but send a 307 if you mean a Temporary Redirect |
| 303 | See Other                     | Response to the request can be found under another URI using a GET method. In response to PUT or POST, indicates the server has performed the operation and the results can be obtained via GET    |
| 304 | Not Modified (RFC 7232)       | Resource has not been modified since the version specified by the request headers If-Modified-Since or If-None-Match, no content is sent and client should use previously downloaded copy          |
| 305 | Use Proxy                     | WARNING: Many browsers deliberately do not handle this correctly due to security concerns. Resource is available only through a proxy, the address for which is is provided in the response        |
| 307 | Temporary Redirect            | Request should be repeated with the provided URI; however future requests should still use the original URI. Differs from 302 in that request VERB does not change, e.g. repeat the PUT or POST    |
| 308 | Permanent Redirect (RFC 7538) | Request and all future requests should be repeated using another URI. Unlike 301, request method must not change, e.g. resubmit a POSTed form at the new URI via POST if you get a 308             |

| 408 | Request Timeout                                               | Server timed out waiting for the request. Client may repeat the request without modifications at a later time                              |
| 409 | Conflict                                                      | Request could not be processed beacuse of conflict int he request, such as an edit conflict between multiple simultaneous updates          |

| 411 | Length Required                                               | Request did not specify the length of its content, which is required by the requested resource                                             |
| 412 | Precondition Failed (RFC 7232)                                | Server does not meet one of the preconditions that the requester put on the request                                                        |

| 414 | Request-URI Too Long (RFC 7231)                               | The URI was too long for the server to process. Previously called "Request-URI Too Long"                                                   |

| 421 | Misdirected Request (RFC 7540)                                | Request was directed at a server that is not able to produce a response, e.g. because of reused connection                                 |
| 422 | Unprocessable Entity (WebDAV; RFC 4918)                       | The request was well-formed but was unable to be followed due to semantic errors                                                           |
