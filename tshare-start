# TODO - I keep changing the list of windows and such. Maybe find a way to
# separate these? E.g. read in a list of window names & initial commands from an
# .rc file? Then the "for name in..." thing would be like "cat .twindowrc |
# while read name; do $TCMD -S /tmp/$SESSION new-window -n $name -t $SESSION; done"
#
# TODO - It would be nice to adapt the initial commands around a bit. Note: This
# is the same comment as the previous one, and that comment was written in
# January 2016. It is now September 2020. That was at CMM and I never needed any
# more turnover once I had things the way I wanted them. Now I'm at KPMG and I'm
# switching between two projects repeatedly that have completely different tmux
# setups. In August I tweaked this file to be informed by the contents of my
# ~/.current-projects file. Today I wanted to change the way one project was set
# up. ALMOST enough to warrant change, but not enough. Documenting this for
# Future Me. If I circle back to this this year, it may be worth burning an hour
# to fix (or four hours to port it to ruby, etc). If I don't circle back to this
# before 2022 then it's probably not worth the payoff. See https://xkcd.com/1205
# "Is It Worth The Time?". Then again, I'm a fussy hacker with OCD and if
# investing the time is worth it in immediate satisfaction, I may do it
# anyway. Just remember that this script has already outlived one major version
# change of tmux and had to be maintained.
#
# CHANGE IMPACT NOTE: This set of scripts automates two different tmux
# implementations (tmux vs. tmate) on two different operating systems (OSX
# vs. Linux). Over the years, it needs very minor maintenance about twice a
# year. Changes to this script have been caused by:
#
# * Wanting the startup sequence to be slighly different. Frequency: maybe
#   yearly, but often entails multiple changes close together as I toss and turn
#   to get comfortable.
# * Switching between Linux and OSX and finding out the previous changes were
#   not compatible on the other OS. Frequency: typically yearly or less, and
#   usually several months after the previous change.
# * Changes to operating system. Frequency: has happened maybe twice, both on
#   OSX, but likely would be more if I hadn't decided to ride this Ubuntu LTS
#   kernel into the ground.
# * Changes to tmux and tmate. This has happened exactly once, when tmux
#   upgraded to 2.0 and had breaking changes.
