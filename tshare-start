# TODO - I keep changing the list of windows and such. Maybe find a way to
# separate these? E.g. read in a list of window names & initial commands from an
# .rc file? Then the "for name in..." thing would be like "cat .twindowrc |
# while read name; do $TCMD -S /tmp/work new-window -n $name -t work; done"
#
# Or, more likely, change this to a ruby file and have a yaml file listing
# windows and the commands to be sent to them

$TCMD -S /tmp/work new-session -s work -n emacs -d

# window    2    3    4       5
for name in bash spec vagrant console; do
    $TCMD -S /tmp/work new-window -n $name -t work
done

# get this party started

# Clear the crap out of window 1, I mean, what even?
$TCMD -S /tmp/work send-keys -t work:1 C-w

$TCMD -S /tmp/work send-keys -t work:1 'emacs' C-m

# leave window 2 (bash) alone

$TCMD -S /tmp/work send-keys -t work:3 'cd ~/cmm/vagrant/code' C-m
# $TCMD -S /tmp/work send-keys -t work:3 'vagrant ssh' C-m
