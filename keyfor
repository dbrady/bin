# keyfor - search Ubuntu Compose map to find the "key for" a given character

# in HTML is just &trade;
# On windows can be typed as ALT-0153
# On OSX can be typed as Option-2
# On Linux can be typed as Win-t-m, or any other way specified in the Compose file

# This script is essentially a wrapper to grep to search the Compose file.

# TODO: this will effectively strip quotes, boo.

# Can do this with grep but ag is awesome. If you don't have it:
# sudo apt install silversearcher-ag
#

# TODO: This isn't ideal but you can either have quotes or you can have search
# options. Right now I choose quotes, and to pass in -i every time (case
# insensitivity)
