#!/usr/bin/env ruby
# denviro - dump file in Rails environment

# Why: Because sometimes I open a settings.yml or config/database.yml and it's
# so full of <%= ... %> garbage that I have no idea what's going on

# Part I - If you launched this script without rails runner, relaunch itself
# under rails runner
unless defined? Rails
  cmd = "bundle exec rails runner #{__FILE__}"
  puts cmd
  system cmd
  exit $?.to_i
end

# Part II - Accept an arg for  filename to parse. Defaults to config/database.yml
if ARGV.count > 0
  file = ARGV.pop
else
  file = "./config/database.yml"
end

# Part III - Load it, bind it, parse it, puts it
puts Erubis::Eruby.new(File.read(file)).result binding
